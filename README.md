## College Management System

This is the backend API for the college management system project. This is a semester project for my DBMS Course. We have been encouraged to directly use SQL queries, instead of relying on ORMs to do our work for us.

This project uses the SQlite as its database.

### Getting started

This project runs on port 3000 by default, but may change this by setting the "PORT" environment variable.
5. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`. Replace 3000 with whatever port value you have set. Ignore if you are using the default value. The home page is the swagger UI documentation of the different endpoints.
